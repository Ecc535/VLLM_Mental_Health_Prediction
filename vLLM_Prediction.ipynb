            "This analysis provides a high-level interpretation of behavioral health patterns inferred from the provided wearable and survey data, grouped by domain:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Circadian Rhythm Stability**: Noted deviations suggest potential impacts on overall health, with fluctuations in step counts (steps_48phi, steps_8phi, steps_12p_reject, steps_IV) indicating possible circadian rhythm disruptions.\n",
            "* **Cardiovascular Variability**: Elevated Heart Rate Variability (HRVD), particularly hrmax_std and hrentropy_std, may reflect increased cardiovascular stress levels, with peak heart rates (hrmax_mean, hrmax_max) suggesting high physical demand during work shifts.\n",
            "* **Work/Shift Regularity**: Low median shift hours and specific entropy values (shift_type_shannon_entropy, shift_hours_shannon_entropy) imply irregular work schedules, potentially contributing to health disparities.\n",
            "* **Daytime Inactivity**: Elevated non-step duration entropy (duration_entropy_non-step_std) suggests sedentary behavior during daylight hours, a critical risk factor for various conditions.\n",
            "* **Morning and Evening Energy Patterns**: Significant differences in morning and evening energy metrics (energy_std, health_std, happiness/alterness/relax metrics) indicate circadian rhythm effects, with morning energy potentially indicative of morning stiffness or fatigue, contrasting sharply with evening relaxation and health benefits.\n",
            "* **Sleep Quality**: Excellent sleep efficiency (sleep_efficiency_median: 94.0), prolonged maximum sleep duration (sleep_duration_max: 602.5 minutes), and Fitbit-derived nap duration (nap_duration_fitbit_max: 152.0 minutes) suggest optimal sleep outcomes, likely contributing to improved well-being.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Takeaways for Behavioral Health:**\n",
            "- **Circadian Misalignment**: Inactivity patterns and energy disparities across day/night suggest potential misalignment between internal circadian rhythms and external schedules, necessitating consideration for schedule adjustments or lifestyle interventions.\n",
            "- **Cardiovascular Stress**: Elevated HRVD and peak heart rates underscore the importance of managing physical stress levels, particularly during work shifts.\n",
            "- **Work Schedule Irregularities**: Irregular work hours and entropy values may indicate productivity challenges or health concerns associated with non-standard work schedules.\n",
            "- **Sleep Optimization**: The data highlights the significance of achieving and maintaining quality sleep, suggesting opportunities for sleep hygiene interventions.\n",
            "- **Holistic Health Implications**: The interplay between circadian rhythms, physical activity, cardiovascular health, and sleep underscores the need for integrated health promotion strategies that address these interconnected factors. **Clinical interpretation should consider individual baselines and contextual factors (e.g., work schedules, caffeine intake) to tailor preventive and therapeutic measures effectively.** \n",
            "\n",
            "**Clinical Actionability Suggestions:**\n",
            "- **Schedule Adjustments**: Explore flexible scheduling options for employees with circadian rhythm concerns.\n",
            "- **Physical Activity Promotion**: Tailor physical activity recommendations based on circadian energy patterns to optimize productivity and health.\n",
            "- **Caffeine Awareness**: Monitor caffeine intake effects, especially for individuals with circadian misalignment or cardiovascular concerns.\n",
            "- **Sleep Hygiene Interventions**: Offer sleep hygiene resources (e.g., dark therapy, pre-sleep routines) to support sleep quality.\n",
            "- **Regular Health Check-Ups**: Incorporate circadian, cardiovascular, and activity level monitoring into routine health assessments to inform preventive care. \n",
